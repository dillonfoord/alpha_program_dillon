# Personal Goals Document - Traders@SMU Alpha Program

*Dillon Foord*  
*dfoord@smu.edu*  
*Level 1 (Junior)*

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

I have no prior experience in quant finance, but have relevant coursework such as Calculus 3, Intro to Statistics, and Linear Algebra. I have novice experience in Python from my AP Comp Sci Principles class. I worked in data entry for 2 summers for 2 different companies which required no data science skills, however today (3/4/25) I secured a remote data science internship with the company OnyxMP GrowthCo, in which I will learn Domo and develop my skills. As far as projects, I made a program through python that can calculate derivatives and integrals based on entry. I have no trading experience (unless we consider Fliff betting experience). Meeting Lauren and Yash through AKPsi is what got me interested in the club, and my passion for math got me interested in the career field. I also really like surrounding myself with people that are smarter than me, which the club and the industry offer in abundance.

## 2. Career Goals

In the short term, I want to be financially comfortable. In the long term, I want generational wealth. I think focusing on becoming a Quantitative Trader is ideal for me, due to my leaning towards math, but I am open to anything, even outside of quantitative finance, as long as I can make my time worth it and use math in my work. I think it would be pretty cool to work for a firm that specializes in high frequency trading, and/or for a hedge fund/market maker. I am open to working in any field of finance, but again I want to use math because math is fulfilling to me and I know there is a slight shortage of math people in my generation. In 1 year, I want to have a summer internship lined up and/or have an early insights experience under my belt. In 5 years I want to be working at a major firm, making a lot of money, and paying my parents back for my college and childhood fees. In 10 years, I want to retire my parents and pay off every expense they have, while living comfortably myself.

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

I want to specifically develop my knowledge of coding languages and learn how to program more effectively. I want to use my linear algebra coursework and apply it to the club. I have a decent understanding of statistics but I want to be more than decent at statistical analysis. I have absolutely minimal knowledge of financial concepts so I want to learn every relevant concept and develop trading strategies that I can use for my personal benefit. I want to hone my skills in python. I will take any networking opportunities that you can provide me, and would love for you to bring in some professionals that are interested in providing career opportunities to the club members.  

## 4. Current Technical Skills

- Programming languages -- Beginner (maybe slightly intermediate)
- Data analysis tools -- Beginner
- Statistical analysis -- Beginner (maybe slightly intermediate)
- Financial modeling -- Beginner
- Machine learning -- Beginner 
- Version control -- Beginner

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

I want to learn the vocabulary of finance, specifically focusing on the Greeks and different trading strategies. I want to learn how to trade for myself. I want to be able to do brain teasers more effectively. I want to get smarter. I will measure my progress by the quizzes you provide us and by quizzing myself. I will also take diligent notes that I can reference. I plan to dedicate at least 5 hours a week, and up to 10 hours. I will be working 15 hours a week for my internship, so I cannot spread myself too thin. I will utilize youtube, industry leaders' education courses, and my peers to develop my knowledge further. My definition of success in life is growth, so for this club success for me will be intellectual growth. If I can look back and say that I am more knowledgeable at the end of the course than I was at the beginning, then I will count that as success.
